#Each value in the input_array (of input dimension) is mapped to a vector 
#of a defined size (output_dimension).
#Think of it as principal components where you map one dimension to another diemsnion(s).
#Obviously, here we are doing PCA. Just mapping one vector to another with some initialization. 
# So a 1 X 10 array gives 1 X 10 X 50 array (input_dim=1x10, output_dim=50).
# Embeddings can be randomly initialized on initialized using 0s or 1s.

#Array of size 10, --> should output size (10,1,50)

Text processing (example: word2vec)
Consider the following example sentences...

Hello, How are you doing - [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] (Hello is 0, are is 1, etc.)
Hello, How are you feeling - [0, 1, 2, 3, 5] (Feeling is 5)

Now, we want to train a network with first layer as embedding layer.

# 2 represents the size of the embedding vector. 
# input length is 5 as our sentences have 5 words length as input sequences.

#Conditional GAN where we provide labels as input.
#We use embedding layer as the first layer to represent each class as a vector.
#e.g., cifar10 dataset has 10 classes. We want these 10 classes to be represented
#by vectors, each, that can be trained as part of discriminator training. 
#Let us say the vector would have a size 50. Then we can add an embedding layer
#of size 50.
